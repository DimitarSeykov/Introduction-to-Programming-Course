Tasks for Basic operations, Conditional statetemts and Logical Operators

0. Check whether a year is leap

1. Given a number of seconds, transform it into HH:MM:SS. Do the reverse operation - given HH MM SS, transform it into seconds

2. You are given a number, an arithmetic symbol and a number. Interpret the mathematical statement correctly
  Examples:
    - 10 / 3 shoudl print 3
    - 11 * 5 should print 55
    - 3 + 4 should print 7
    - 8 - 11 should print -3
    - 20 % 6 should print 2

3. Validate date (DD MM YYYY) (example: February cannot have 30 days)

4. You have a starting time in (hh mm ss) format and ending time in the same format. Calculate how much time has passed between the two. (Midnight is a thing) 

5. Check whether a point is in a rectangle (given two diagonal points) *

6. Check whether a point is in a circle given its radius **

7. Calculate overlapping area of rectangles *

8. Given a letter, print its base16 equivalent (A to 10, B to 11, ..., F to 15, all others -> print error)

9. Find (and print) the biggest digit of a given 3 (or 4, your choice) digit number. Print the sum of all digits.

10. Check whether 2 symbols are the lower and upper of the same letter and print "Yes" or "No". (Example: 'A' is the upper of 'a', but 'S' is not the upper of 't'.

11. Check if a number is a palindrome (a palindrome is a string (or a number) that is read in the same way forwards and backwards - aba, racecar, 123321)

12. Swap two numbers


* A rectangle is defined by (x1, y1) -> top left corner and (x2, y2) -> bottom right corner.
** Assume the circle's centre is (0, 0). If you want a greater challenge, make the centre ot the circle a part of the input.
