0. Define a `struct Point` with fields `double x` and `double y`.

1. Write a function `double distanceBetweenTwoPoints (Point& p1, Point& p2)` that calculates the Euclidean distance between two points in the plane. 

1.1 Make the function a method in the Point struct. It should look like this: `double calculateDistaceToOtherPoint(Point& otherPoint)`.

2. Define a  `struct Rational` with fields `int numerator` and `int denominator`.

3. Define functions for all basic operations with Rational numbers - `Rational addRationals(Rational& r1, Rational& r2)`. To the same for multiplication, substraction and divison.

3.1 Make the funcions methods of the Rational struct.
